               <h2 id="agreement-to-terms">AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
               <p>These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on
                    behalf of
                    an entity (&quot;you&quot;) and HelpHog LLC (&quot;Company&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;), concerning your
                    access to and
                    use of the <a href="https://helphog.com">https://helphog.com</a> website as well as any other media
                    form,
                    media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto
                    (collectively, the &quot;Site&quot;). The Site provides an online marketplace for the following goods,
                    products, and/or
                    services: automotive services; creative services; educational services; household services; labor
                    services;
                    pet services; tech services (the &quot;Marketplace Offerings&quot;). In order to help make the Site a secure
                    environment
                    for the purchase and sale of Marketplace Offerings, all users are required to accept and comply with
                    these
                    Terms of Use, including the User Agreement posted on the Site, which are incorporated into these
                    Terms of Use.
                    You agree that by accessing the Site and/or the Marketplace Offerings, you have read, understood,
                    and agree to
                    be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU
                    ARE
                    EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND/OR THE MARKETPLACE OFFERINGS AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE
                    USE
                    IMMEDIATELY.</p>
               <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are
                    hereby
                    expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make
                    changes or
                    modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any
                    changes by
                    updating the &quot;Last updated&quot; date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific
                    notice of
                    each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use to stay
                    informed of
                    updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted,
                    the
                    changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised
                    Terms of Use
                    are posted. </p>
               <p>The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
                    entity in any
                    jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
                    which would
                    subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those
                    persons who
                    choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely
                    responsible for
                    compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
               <p>The Site is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability
                    and
                    Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your
                    interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site. You may not use the Site in
                    a way
                    that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>
               <p>The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not
                    permitted to
                    use or register for the Site or use the Marketplace Offerings.</p>
               <p>All users promise that:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>You are at least 18 years old and reside in the United States.</li>
                    <li>Tasks shall only be performed in the United States.</li>
                    <li>You will respect the privacy of other users, and will not record any interaction with any user

                         their prior consent.</li>
                    <li>You will communicate in a timely fashion, be present at the time you agree upon with your
                         provider or
                         client, and only utilize Stripe to make or receive payments for services.</li>
                    <li>You will use your real name on your profile.</li>
                    <li>You will not use our platform for any illegal service.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>All providers additionally promise that:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>You will follow all relevant laws while completing tasks and act in good faith.</li>
                    <li>When using the platform as a provider you are operating as an independent contractor for the
                         client.
                         You have the unrestricted right to work within your jurisdiction.</li>

               </ul>
               <h2 id="terms">TERMS</h2>
               <p>There are several statuses that an order may currently be. These have specific names that are
                    referenced
                    throughout the rest of this agreement. Here is a list of the relevant order status names and what
                    they mean:
               </p>
               <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automatically Cancelled:</strong> Services ordered on our platform are automatically
                         cancelled if
                         not enough providers claim the order. The time at which this happens is the midpoint between
                         when the
                         order was placed and when it was scheduled to take place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Cancelled:</strong> Customers have the right to cancel any order up until the
                         time that
                         the order is started by the provider. See our payment section for more information about this.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Provider Cancelled:</strong> Providers can cancel any order so long as they have not yet
                         started
                         the order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refunded:</strong> Providers can choose to refund the customer in the event that they
                         personally
                         feel their work as inadequate. This can be done on our platform after they have stopped the
                         order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pending:</strong> An order that has just been placed and is waiting to be claimed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Claimed:</strong> After an order is placed by the customer, providers can respond to
                         email/text
                         notifications to indicate they would like to complete the service. After the number of
                         providers who have
                         responded is equal to the number of providers requested by the customer, the service is
                         considered
                         claimed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Started:</strong> Providers start orders to indicate that they have begun completing the
                         service.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ended:</strong> Providers end orders to indicate that they have stopped working on the
                         service.
                         Providers can also pause services to indicate that they have temporarily stopped providing the
                         service.
                         &quot;Working time&quot; as mentioned later is defined as the time between the start time and end time,
                         not
                         including any paused time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marked Completed:</strong> Providers mark orders as completed on our platform when they
                         feel that
                         they have adequately provided the service. Our platform automatically marks orders as completed
                         24 hours
                         after they attain a status of &quot;ended&quot;. Payment remains on hold in the HelpHog Stripe account
                         until
                         either: the order maintains this status for 24 hours, or the customer indicates they are happy
                         with the
                         service by marking the order as completed on our platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disputed:</strong> After a service is marked completed by the provider, customers will
                         have the
                         opportunity to dispute an order if they feel that the service was inadequate or the final price
                         is
                         incorrect. Providers have the opportunity to resolve the order in whatever way they see fit
                         without the
                         involvement of HelpHog, and then mark the order as completed again. If the order is disputed
                         several
                         times by the customer, it will remain in this status and our informal negotiation process will
                         take
                         effect, described in more detail elsewhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paid:</strong> The funds that were initially placed on hold within the customer&#39;s bank
                         account
                         have been transferred from the HelpHog Stripe account to the provider. Order is resolved at
                         this point,
                         and is excluded from our informal negotiation. Order may not enter any of the order statuses
                         from here.
                    </li>
               </ul>
               <h2 id="helphog-connects-providers-with-customers">HELPHOG CONNECTS PROVIDERS WITH CUSTOMERS</h2>
               <p>The HelpHog platform, available on web and mobile, is a marketplace that connects customers to
                    providers.
                    Customers are clients of the provider, where the provider provides services to the customer.
                    Therefore,
                    providers are entities seeking to fulfil orders of the customer. </p>
               <p>PROVIDERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT EMPLOYEES OF HELPHOG. PROVIDERS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVES
                    OF THE
                    HELPHOG PLATFORM. HELPHOG DOES NOT FULFILL SERVICES FOR THE CUSTOMER ON THE BEHALF OF THE PROVIDER.
                    HELPHOG IS
                    AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE THAT CONNECTS THE PROVIDER TO THE CUSTOMER THAT IS IN NEED OF THE SERVICE.
               </p>
               <p>USERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HELPHOG DOES NOT FACILITATE, CONTROL, OR DIRECT ANY PART OF THE
                    PROVIDER&#39;S WORK.
                    HELPHOG IS NOT LIABLE FOR WORK DONE BY THE PROVIDER AND DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
                    FROM THE
                    SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE PROVIDERS ON THE HELPHOG PLATFORM.</p>
               <p>Helphog has no control over the communication of the providers with the HelpHog&#39;s customers. Helphog
                    gives no
                    warranties on the accuracy of the services provided or the timeliness of the services. </p>
               <h2 id="background-checks">BACKGROUND CHECKS</h2>
               <p>Providers are required to undergo a criminal background check before they can use our platform. This
                    will be
                    done using a third party service. If you are a provider, you agree to tell us about any relevant
                    criminal
                    convictions that happen while you have an account with us. We do not maintain any liability for the
                    reliability of the background check information, or for any false or misleading statements made by
                    providers.
               </p>
               <h2 id="provider-and-client-contract">PROVIDER AND CLIENT CONTRACT</h2>
               <p>You agree that a legally binding contract with another user is formed when you and said user agree on
                    the terms
                    of a task. The terms of this agreement may include contractual terms accepted by both the provider
                    and client
                    so long as they do not conflict with these conditions. HelpHog is not a party to any agreement and
                    will not
                    create an employment relationship between itself and any provider. Clients are responsible for
                    confirming with
                    their provider that they are registered on the HelpHog platform.</p>
               <p>Providers are required to personally perform tasks. They may not engage other personnel. Failure to
                    comply with
                    this may lead to removal from the HelpHog platform.</p>
               <p>Clients may decide whether they will be present or not when tasks are being completed. If someone
                    other than the
                    client books the task on their behalf, or is present when the task is being performed, then the
                    provider may
                    take directions from the replacement person as if the direction was given from the client
                    themselves. Clients
                    are responsible and liable for any acts, omissions, or directions given by their replacement
                    individual.</p>
               <p>Clients must pay providers in full for all services at the rates agreed to during checkout. Both
                    client and
                    providers agree to comply with this agreement during the duration of each task.</p>

               <h2 id="marketplace-offerings">MARKETPLACE OFFERINGS</h2>
               <p>We reserve the right to limit the quantities of the Marketplace Offerings offered or available on the

               <h2 id="payment-and-payout">PAYMENT AND PAYOUT</h2>
               <p>We accept the following forms of payment: </p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Visa</li>
                    <li>Mastercard</li>

                    purchases of the
                    Marketplace Offerings made via the Site. You further agree to promptly update account and payment
                    information,
                    including email address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can complete
                    your
                    transactions and contact you as needed. Sales tax will be added to the price of purchases as deemed
                    required
                    by us. We may change prices at any time. All payments shall be in U.S. dollars. </p>
               <p>You agree to pay all charges at the prices then in effect for your purchases and any applicable
                    shipping fees,
                    and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon placing your
                    order. If
                    your order is subject to recurring charges, then you consent to our charging your payment method on
                    a
                    recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until such time as
                    you cancel
                    the applicable order. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if we
                    have
                    already requested or received payment.</p>
               <p>HelpHog facilitates payments between the customer and the provider. Customers of the HelpHog platform
                    directly
                    contract other providers. Payment for contracted work is processed through a third-party payment
                    provider.
                    HelpHog is not responsible to compensate the provider for any failure of payment on the behalf of
                    the
                    customer.</p>
               <p>Costs of services are calculated by HelpHog and are affected by the provider&#39;s engagement in the
                    service. Hourly
                    services charge the customer for time the provider is providing the service (specifics for the
                    provider&#39;s
                    engagement is mentioned in the order statuses section of this document). Flat rate services are
                    billed on
                    completion. </p>
               <p>Upon placing an order on the HelpHog platform, the customer&#39;s funds are placed on hold within the
                    cardholder&#39;s
                    bank. The funds placed on hold in the customer&#39;s bank account are equivalent to the maximum payable
                    amount for
                    the service. The maximum payable amount is calculated and displayed to the customer prior to
                    checkout. The
                    maximum payable amount is calculated based on the service and the specific parameters of the order.
                    The
                    calculated payable amount may include VAT or sales tax that is applicable to the service being
                    provided.
                    Customer&#39;s funds that are placed on hold remain on hold until the service is fulfilled or cancelled.
                    When an
                    order is marked as completed, the funds are captured from the customer&#39;s bank and the payable
                    amount is
                    adjusted to the outcome of the service. If the provider worked for less time than anticipated, the
                    captured
                    amount will be less than that of the maximum payable amount. </p>
               <p>The customer has 24 hours to dispute the transaction (further mentioned in the disputes section) after
                    the order
                    is marked completed. The outcome of the dispute may result in a full or partial refund of the
                    payment. The
                    customer is responsible for completing the dispute within 24 hours of the order being marked
                    completed. </p>
               <p>Orders cancelled by the HelpHog platform or the provider result in the full refund of the funds placed
                    on hold
                    in the customer&#39;s bank account. Orders cancelled by the customer may inflict a &quot;late cancellation
                    fee&quot;. Orders
                    cancelled by the customer within 24 hours of the order time will result in additional charges. The
                    HelpHog
                    platform may or may not use the &quot;late cancellation fee&quot; to pay the provider for the inconvenience
                    caused due
                    to the late cancellation.</p>
               <p>Funds on actively disputed orders remain pending with HelpHog until both parties, the customer and the
                    provider,
                    resolve the issue of the dispute and no new disputes are issued within 24 hours of the previous
                    dispute.</p>
               <p>Payouts are managed by a third-party payment provider. In order to withdraw funds from HelpHog, the
                    provider may
                    need to upload additional information to the third-party provider. A fee for withdrawing funds may
                    be deducted
                    from the total payout amount. </p>
               <p>Helphog charges 10% of the total service amount as a platform usage fee. The usage fee deducts 10% of
                    the amount
                    paid by the customer from the provider, excluding sales tax, VAT, or any other relevant fee.</p>
               <p>HelpHog reserves the right to hold, refund, or decline any payment in case of the suspicion of fraud
                    or misuse
                    of the HelpHog platform</p>
               <p>We reserve the right to refuse any order placed through the Site. We may, in our sole discretion,
                    limit or
                    cancel quantities purchased per person, per household, or per order. These restrictions may include
                    orders
                    placed by or under the same customer account, the same payment method, and/or orders that use the
                    same billing
                    or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment,
                    appear to be
                    placed by dealers, resellers, or distributors.</p>

               <h3 id="informal-negotiations">Informal Negotiations</h3>
               <p>By placing an order and entering into the terms of our service agreement, both the customer and
                    provider
                    acknowledge and agree to our informal negotiation process in the event that a conflict arises. The
                    process is
                    as follows:</p>
               <p>In the event that customers and providers fail to resolve a dispute between themselves, HelpHog
                    intervenes with
                    an informal negotiation process where HelpHog acts as a mediator of the case.</p>
               <p>HelpHog&#39;s mediation occurs when an order has been disputed by the customer several times, even if the
                    provider
                    feels that they have done an adequate job.</p>
               <p>In the event of HelpHog&#39;s mediation, a mediator from HelpHog will contact both parties and use their
                    best
                    judgement on resolving the cause. The mediator will communicate with the provider and customer to
                    understand
                    the intentions of each party. The length and nature of the mediation are up to the discretion of
                    HelpHog. The
                    HelpHog mediator will rule the final decision of the paid amount by the customer. </p>
               <p>USERS HEREBY AGREE TO THE DECISION MADE BY THE HELPHOG MEDIATOR AND MUST ACT IN ACCORDANCE. THE
                    MEDIATOR IS
                    BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND WILL ACT IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE IMPARTIALLY.

                    (individually, a &quot;Party&quot; and collectively, the &quot;Parties&quot;), the Parties agree to
                    first
                    attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at
                    least
                    thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
                    notice from
                    one Party to the other Party.</p>
               <h3 id="binding-arbitration">Binding Arbitration</h3>
               <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except
                    those Disputes
                    expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU
                    UNDERSTAND
                    THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The
                    arbitration
                    shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                    Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAA&#39;s Supplementary Procedures for
                    Consumer Related
                    Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the AAA website:
                    www.adr.org. Your
                    arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer
                    Rules and,
                    where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person,
                    through the
                    submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but
                    need not
                    provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
                    applicable law,
                    and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by
                    the
                    applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Snohomish County,
                    Washington.
                    Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                    proceedings
                    pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
                    arbitrator.
               </p>
               <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced
                    or
                    prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Snohomish County, Washington, and the Parties
                    hereby
                    consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with
                    respect to
                    venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations

                    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
                    (UCITA) is
                    excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>
               <p>If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
                    any
                    Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such
                    Dispute
                    shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
                    above, and the
                    Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
               <h3 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h3>
               <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
                    individually. To the
                    full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
                    there is no
                    right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class
                    action
                    procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
                    representative
                    capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

               <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
                    informal
                    negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning
                    the
                    validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
                    arising from,
                    allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
                    injunctive
                    relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
                    arbitrate
                    any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
                    such
                    Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
                    jurisdiction above,
                    and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
