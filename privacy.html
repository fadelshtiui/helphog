			<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track

				follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy

				provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
			<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to
				make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
				for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information
